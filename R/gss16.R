#' Data from the 2016 General Social Survey (GSS)
#'
#' The GSS gathers data on contemporary American society in order to monitor and
#' explain trends and constants in attitudes, behaviors, and attributes.
#' Hundreds of trends have been tracked since 1972. In addition, since the GSS
#' adopted questions from earlier surveys, trends can be followed for up to 70 years.

#' The GSS contains a standard core of demographic, behavioral, and attitudinal
#' questions, plus topics of special interest. Among the topics covered are civil
#' liberties, crime and violence, intergroup tolerance, morality, national spending
#' priorities, psychological well-being, social mobility, and stress and traumatic events.

#' The data come from the [NORC at the University of Chicago](https://gss.norc.org/Get-The-Data)
