\description{
Every election cycle brings its own brand of excitement – and lots of money.
Political donations are of particular interest to political scientists and
other researchers studying politics and voting patterns.
They are also of interest to citizens who want to stay informed of how much
money their candidates raise and where that money comes from.

\details{
In the United States, “only American citizens (and immigrants with green
cards) can contribute to federal politics, but the American divisions of
foreign companies can form political action committees (PACs) and collect
contributions from their American employees.” (Source: \href{https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/foreign-connected-pacs}{OpenSecrets.org})

The data come from the
\href{https://www.opensecrets.org/political-action-committees-pacs/foreign-connected-pacs}{OpenSecrets.org}.

The data were scraped from the OpenSecrets.org website in June 2020.
It is part of a series of similar datasets in this package consisting of
datasets collected from OpenSecrets via webscraping.

This particular dataset consists of the data for foreign-connected PAC
contributions for the 2020 election cycle, with some cleaning also done to
make it more accessible in introductory data science education.
