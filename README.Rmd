The goal of dsbox is to supplement the Data Science Course in a Box project. The package contains the datasets that are used in the materials in Data Science Course in a Box as well as the learnr tutorials.

## Installation

<!--

You can install the released version of dsbox from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("dsbox")
```
And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

-->

dsbox is not yet on CRAN. For now, you can install it from GitHub with

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rstudio-education/dsbox")
```

## Questions, bugs, feature requests

You can file an issue to get help, report a bug, or make a feature request.

When filing an issue to get help or report a bug, please make a minimal **repr**oducible **ex**ample using the [reprex](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/) package. 
If you haven't heard of or used reprex before, you're in for a treat! 
Seriously, reprex will make all of your R-question-asking endeavors easier (which is a pretty insane ROI for the five to ten minutes it'll take you to learn what it's all about). 
For additional reprex pointers, check out the [Get help!](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) section of the tidyverse site.

Before opening a new issue, be sure to [search issues and pull requests](https://github.com/rstudio-education/dsbox/issues) to make sure the bug hasn't been reported and/or already fixed in the development version. 
By default, the search will be pre-populated with `is:issue is:open`. 
You can [edit the qualifiers](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/) (e.g. `is:pr`, `is:closed`) as needed. 
For example, you'd simply remove `is:open` to search _all_ issues in the repo, open or closed.
